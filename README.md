## What is MVC ?

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a *pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.* It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display.

*Model*
* The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

*View*
* Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

*Controller*
* Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

## Use in web applications

Although originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as a design for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several web frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These software frameworks vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server.
